1. High level description of project.

Oil companies spend a lot on oil and gas exploration while the success rate is still not high at Gulf of Mexico. It will be very helpful if we can use all available wells/drills information to guide future exploration.

2. What question or problem are you trying to solve?

Given the information about all the wells we have drilled in Gulf of Mexico, can we predict whether it will be a success for next drill?

3. How will you present your work?

    • I plan to present my work in slides. 
    
4. What are your data sources?
