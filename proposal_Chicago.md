1. High level description of project.

Big data could improve understanding of crime and be used to fight crime. Maybe we can do better by not only focus on crime data but also other public data record. Taxi data in Chicago will be used to analysis and predict crime. 

2. What question or problem are you trying to solve?

Could data on how taxis travel through communities be helpful for better understanding of crime in Chicago? Are there any correlation between them?

3. How will you present your work?

    • I plan to present my work in slides.

4. What are your data sources?

       Crime:
       https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?category=Public%20Safety
       
       Taxi:
       https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/wrvz-psew.csv API

5. What’s your next step towards making this your project. 

    • Get API data and see how can I merge the two datasets.
